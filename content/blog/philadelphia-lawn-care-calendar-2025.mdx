> **Quick idea:** this guide is built for **Philadelphia (Zone 7a)**. It favors cool-season lawns (tall fescue, Kentucky bluegrass, perennial rye). We keep it simple: mow high, water deep, feed mostly in fall.

## What Zone 7a means for Philly
Zone 7a has relatively cold winters and hot, humid summers. For cool-season grasses, that means:
- Grow fast in **spring** and **fall**.
- **Protect** during summer heat: mow higher and water deeper.
- Do most of your **feeding and seeding in fall** (late Aug–Oct).

## Core settings: mowing height & watering

**Recommended mowing heights (cool-season):**

| Grass type           | Spring/Fall | Summer (heat) |
|----------------------|-------------|----------------|
| Tall fescue          | 3.0–4.0″    | 3.5–4.0″       |
| Kentucky bluegrass   | 2.5–3.5″    | 3.0–3.5″       |
| Perennial ryegrass   | 2.5–3.0″    | 3.0–3.5″       |

> Rule of thirds: never remove more than **⅓** of the blade at a time.

**Watering:** Aim for about **1″ per week** total (rain + irrigation). Prefer **2–3 deep waterings** per week instead of daily sprinkles. Water early morning to reduce disease.

**Pre-emergent basics (crabgrass):** Apply when **soil** stays near **55°F** for a few days (often **late March–mid April** in Philly). If you plan to seed soon, avoid pre-emergent (wait ~8–10 weeks after).

## Month-by-month calendar

### March
- **Clean-up & inspection:** sticks, debris, salt damage along curbs, low spots.
- **Rake/"light dethatch"** to stand up matted areas.
- **Pre-emergent** window opens as soils warm toward ~55°F (watch the forecast).  
- **First mow**: only when grass is actually growing; set the deck **high**.
- **Edging pass** to establish clean lines for the season.

### April
- Keep mowing **high** as growth ramps.
- **Spot-treat broadleaf weeds** (dandelions, plantain) — target, don't blanket.
- **Light spring feeding** if needed (many cool-season lawns can skip spring and save feeding for fall).
- Check irrigation coverage; place tuna cans to verify ~½″ per session.

### May
- Growth is fast; stick to the **⅓ rule** and don't scalp.
- Sharpen/replace blade for clean cuts (healthier color, fewer ragged tips).
- If temps spike, **raise height** and start **deep watering** pattern.

### June
- Heat management month: maintain **higher mowing height**.
- Water early morning, **2–3×/week** to reach ~1″ weekly total.
- Avoid aggressive work (heavy dethatch) that stresses turf.

### July
- Philly humidity + heat → prioritize turf **survival** over perfection.
- Keep mowing tall; skip a mow if lawn is dormant rather than cutting too low.
- Watch for disease; morning watering only, improve airflow, avoid evening wet blades.

### August
- Late month begins your **fall comeback**.
- Prepare for **overseeding**: choose seed, measure lawn area, plan irrigation schedule. (Use our area guide: [How to Measure Your Lawn Square Footage](/blog/how-to-measure-lawn-square-footage-philadelphia-2025))
- If you used spring pre-emergent, ensure the waiting period is over before seeding.

### September
- **Prime overseeding window** (late Aug–mid Oct; early Sept is ideal).  
- Optional **core aeration** if soil is compacted or thatch is heavy.  
- **Starter fertilizer** at seeding if a soil test supports it.  
- Keep seedbed **evenly moist** for 2–3 weeks (short, frequent waterings), then transition to deeper/less frequent.

### October
- Continue nurturing new seedlings; resume normal deep watering gradually.
- **Main fall feeding** (your biggest application of the year).
- **Leaf strategy:** mulch modest leaf fall into the lawn or remove heavy, wet layers to avoid smothering.

### November
- **Final mow** about **½″ lower** than usual to reduce snow mold risk.
- Last leaf cleanups; protect new grass from heavy foot traffic.
- Winterize hoses, shut outdoor valves, store equipment clean and dry.

### December–February
- Avoid walking on **frozen** turf to prevent crown breakage.
- Off-season: sharpen blades, service mower, plan next season, order seed early.

## Common Philly mistakes
- **Cutting too low in summer.** Taller blades shade soil, keep roots cooler, choke weeds.  
- **Shallow, frequent watering.** Trains roots to stay near the surface; switch to deep, infrequent.  
- **Late spring pre-emergent or applying before seeding.** Time it to soil temps; skip if you plan to seed soon.  
- **Ignoring leaves.** A heavy, wet mat smothers turf; mulch in light layers or remove.
