## Typical ranges by frequency (small/medium lots)
> For flat yards without extreme complexity. Final pricing is confirmed via the Quote form.

| Frequency        | Typical price per visit |
|------------------|-------------------------|
| Weekly           | $35–$65                 |
| Every 2 weeks    | $55–$90                 |
| One-time mow     | $80–$140                |

*Why it varies:* longer intervals mean taller, thicker grass — more passes, more cleanup, more time.

## Lot size impact
- up to ~2,000 sq ft — see base ranges above  
- 2,000–4,000 sq ft — add ~$10–$25  
- 4,000–8,000 sq ft — add ~$20–$50  
- >8,000 sq ft — custom (subscription often saves)

## Factors that add cost
- **Steep slopes, stairs, tight gates** (time/safety)
- **Overgrown or wet grass** (extra passes, clumping)
- **Lots of obstacles** (beds, trees, stones)
- **Pet waste or debris** (cleanup surcharge)

## By area (logistics & parking)
*We factor travel/parking and route density. Final number is confirmed in the request.*

- Northeast / Roxborough / Bustleton — usually no surcharge on route days  
- Center City / South Philly — possible add-on for parking/logistics  
- Nearby suburbs to NE — no surcharge on route day

## Edging & hedge trimming — typical add-ons
- **Edging** along walkways/beds: +$5–$20 depending on footage  
- **Hedge trimming:** small $15–$40, medium $40–$80, large by photos/visit

## Save 10–20% with simple moves
1. **Route day:** choose the day we're already in your neighborhood.  
2. **Prep the yard:** put away toys/hoses for faster work.  
3. **Stay regular:** weekly costs less per visit and keeps turf healthy.  
4. **Neighbors:** bundle two or more houses for one trip.  
5. **Pre-pay monthly:** often includes a discount.
