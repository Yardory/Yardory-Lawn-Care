faq:
  - q: "How accurate does my number need to be?"
    a: "Within ~10% is usually fine for estimates. We verify on-site and adjust before service."
  - q: "How do I exclude the house, driveway, and patio?"
    a: "Outline only the turf areas in Google Maps, or measure those hard surfaces and subtract from the total."
  - q: "Front and back yards — add them together?"
    a: "Yes. Measure each area and sum the square footage."
  - q: "Is the property lot size the same as lawn size?"
    a: "No. Lot size includes the house/driveway/beds. Measure just the grass you want serviced."
  - q: "What if my yard has an unusual shape?"
    a: "Break it into simple shapes (rectangles, triangles) and calculate each area separately, then add them together."
  - q: "How do I measure slopes or hills in my yard?"
    a: "Measure the flat area (footprint) of the slope. The actual surface area is larger, but we price based on the flat footprint for mowing."
  - q: "Google Maps on my phone only shows distance — how do I get area?"
    a: "Use the free Google Earth app (iOS/Android) to draw a polygon and see square footage, or approximate in Google Maps with rectangles and triangles (see Method 2)."

Philadelphia homeowners often struggle with measuring their lawn for accurate quotes. Whether you're getting your first lawn care estimate or switching providers, knowing your square footage helps you get the right price and service level.

In this guide, you'll learn:
- **Three fast methods** to measure your lawn (Google Maps, phone, tape measure)
- **How to exclude** house, driveway, and hardscape areas
- **Simple formulas** for different yard shapes
- **What information** to include in your quote request

If you only have 2–3 minutes, use **Google Maps** and outline the green areas. That's accurate enough for quotes and helps you pick the right size in our form.

## Method 1 — Google Maps on desktop (quick & accurate)
1. Open **maps.google.com** and search your address.  
2. **Right-click** on your lawn → **Measure distance**.  
3. Click around the perimeter of the grass to make a shape (include side strips you want mowed).  
4. Close the shape by clicking the first point.  
5. Google shows **Area** at the bottom (sq ft and m²). That's your lawn square footage.  
6. Have separate front/back areas? Make two shapes and **add the areas**.

**Pro tips**
- Outline **only turf**, not beds, patios, or driveways.  
- If you see metric only, open Google Maps settings and switch to U.S. units.  
- Save a screenshot to attach in your quote.

## Method 2 — On your phone (2 easy options)

### Option A — Google **Earth** app (accurate area on mobile)
1. Install **Google Earth** (iOS/Android) and search your address.  
2. Tap the **Measure** (ruler) tool → choose **Area** / polygon mode.  
3. Tap around the grass edges to create a closed shape (pinch-zoom for precision).  
4. When you close the shape, Earth shows **Area (sq ft)** and **Perimeter**.  
5. Do separate shapes for front/back and **add** the areas.

> Tip: Outline turf only — skip the house, driveway and patios.

### Option B — Stay in Google **Maps** (distance only → use quick formulas)
If Maps only reports distance on your phone, approximate area with a couple of distances:

**Rectangles** — measure **Length (L)** and **Width (W)** with "Measure distance", then  
`Area = L × W`.

**Triangles** — when a corner is angled, measure **base (b)** and the perpendicular **height (h)**, then  
`Area = ½ × b × h`.

**L-shapes** — split into two rectangles, compute each, then **add**.

**Circles/curves** — treat as a rectangle, or as a **sector** if you prefer:  
`Area ≈ π × r² × (θ / 360°)` (measure radius r and estimate angle θ).

**Subtract hard surfaces** — house/driveway/patio areas can be rectangles/triangles too; compute and **subtract**.

**Pacing hack (no tape):** walk a known 50 ft, count steps → your stride = `50 ÷ steps`. Use stride × steps to approximate L/W.

#### Worked example
Front yard looks like a rectangle 30 ft × 20 ft plus a triangular wedge (base 12 ft, height 6 ft):

- Rectangle: `30 × 20 = 600 sq ft`  
- Triangle: `½ × 12 × 6 = 36 sq ft`  
- **Total:** `636 sq ft`

## Method 3 — Tape or pacing (good for small simple shapes)
Use these formulas (measure in feet):

- **Rectangle:** length × width  
- **Triangle:** 0.5 × base × height  
- **Circle:** π × r² (r = radius in feet)  
- **L-shapes:** split into rectangles, calculate each, then add them

**Pacing hack:** walk a known 50 ft distance and count steps → your **stride** = 50 ÷ steps. Use that stride to approximate lengths when a tape isn't handy.

## Subtract hardscape the easy way
Either (a) outline only grass in Google Maps or (b) measure the **house footprint**, **driveway**, and **patio** and **subtract** from a larger outline. Beds and mulched areas can be excluded if you don't want trimming there.

## Quick conversions
- **Acres = sq ft ÷ 43,560**  
- 1,000 sq ft ≈ **0.023 ac**  
- 5,000 sq ft ≈ **0.115 ac**  
- 10,000 sq ft ≈ **0.23 ac**

> For service and pricing, **square footage is enough** — no need to be exact to the inch.

## What to include in your quote (helps us lower your price)
- Address + **square footage bucket** (from the form)  
- **Gate width** (important for equipment access)  
- Notes on **slopes**, **obstacles**, pets  
- Photos (front/back) or your Google Maps screenshot
